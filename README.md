# Signal Processing of an ECG

### Description
The program uses digital filtering to remove narrowband noise from an ECG. This is done with an IIR filter (designed using pole placement) and 3 FIR filters (designed with the window method, optimal method and frequency-sampling) and the results are compared and graphed. This program was originally designed as part of ENEL420 Assignment 1.
